       "  'Description': [\"For sale is a 2016 MacBook Pro in mint condition, owned by a tech enthusiast who cares for their tech like a nerd. This laptop has always had DBrand skins, a keyboard protector and a screen protector, keeping it in pristine condition & new ones have been put on.\\nLaptop is equipped with a 15-inch screen and has a powerful 2.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory, and Radeon Pro 450 2 GB Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB graphics specifications.\\nIn addition to the care that has been taken to keep the laptop in excellent condition, the screen and top half of the laptop were replaced by Apple two to three years ago due to an issue with the screen's protective film peeling. The result is a laptop that almost looks new.\\nTHE FOLLOWING DETAILS ARE FOR HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY\\nI believe this laptop is priced appropriately that reflects its age and condition. \\nPlease note that the laptop needs a new battery (if you're up for replacing it) and can be used for 30 minutes to an hour without being plugged in. When connected to power, it can be used for as long as needed. The fans kick in more often, especially during video calls, and the base can get quite warm when running multiple applications. However, a diagnostic report has been run, and there are no known issues (see photos)\\nThe laptop has been used daily for personal and work computer and works perfectly for tasks such as browsing the web on Chrome or Safari, using Microsoft products, working on Google Drive products like Sheets and Docs, using Slack, Miro, Outlook, and Notion.\\nI find that when I run multiple application's and multiple web pages, the laptop struggles, slows down, get hot. So I advice that this be used for light duties, it's over 6 years old going on 7. The owner is happy to provide additional information to potential buyers and can provide screen shots of system reports if there is anything specific they want to know about. We want to make sure that you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.\"],\n",
