The result is a laptop that almost looks new.\nTHE FOLLOWING DETAILS ARE FOR HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY\nI believe this laptop is priced appropriately that reflects its age and condition. \nPlease note that the laptop needs a new battery (if you're up for replacing it) and can be used for 30 minutes to an hour without being plugged in. When connected to power, it can be used for as long as needed. The fans kick in more often, especially during video calls, and the base can get quite warm when running multiple applications. However, a diagnostic report has been run, and there are no known issues (see photos)\nThe laptop has been used daily for personal and work computer and works perfectly for tasks such as browsing the web on Chrome or Safari, using Microsoft products, working on Google Drive products like Sheets and Docs, using Slack, Miro, Outlook, and Notion.\nI find that when I run multiple application's and multiple web pages, the laptop struggles, slows down, get hot.
